\begin{abstract}
The rapid adoption of microbial whole genome sequencing in public health, clinical testing, and forensic laboratories requires the use of validated and well characterized measurement processes. Reference materials that are well characterized, homogeneous, and stable can be used to evaluate measurement processes and help to establish confidence in the results. Given the variety of microbial genome sequencing applications and platforms, as well as the vast microbial genomic diversity, there is a need for application-specific genomic materials for method validation. We have developed a reproducibile and transparent bioinformatics tool for characterize prokaryotic genomic materials; "PEPR", Pipelines for Evaluating Prokaryotic References. We demonstrate the tool and its output using a candidate reference material based on genomic material from \emph{Staphylococcus aureus}.

%%% Steve's comments
%%% I read through your manuscript and have attached my suggested typo corrections.  One larger scale comment: the paper felt a little too repetitive while reading – the methods, results, and discussion all repeated the genome evaluation, genome characterization and genomic purity trifecta.  If possible, it could be helpful to either combine some of these descriptions or to more strongly differentiate their respective messages.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Over the past decade, the availability of affordable and rapid Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized the field of microbiology. Arguably the most discriminatory typing method available, whole genome sequencing (WGS), has been adopted not only by the research community, but also by public health laboratories, clinical testing laboratories, and the forensic community. High stakes decisions are often made based on the outcome of a WGS assay. To increase confidence in WGS assay results a critical assessment of the errors inherent to the measurement processes is required. A number of sources of error associated with the WGS measurement process have been identified, but the degree to which they can be predicted, controlled or compensated varies significantly \cite{Olson2015}. 

Well-characterized, homogeneous, and stable genomic materials can be used to evaluate methods and aid in establishing confidence in results from a measurement process. For example, we recently characterized a whole human genome reference material (National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, Reference Material 8398) to assess performance of variant calling in human genomic samples \cite{Zook2014}, but no reference materials for microbial sequencing currently exist. Four microbial genomic DNA candidate reference materials are being developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to meet this need. When considering the extensive genomic diversity present within prokaryotic organisms as well as the rapidly evolving and diverse DNA sequencing applications currently present, we envision the need for a wide variety of application-specific genomic materials for use in method validation and benchmarking. Currently, many laboratories and sequencing centers are using in-house materials as part of a regular method validation and quality control system. However, the degree to which these materials are characterized varies significantly, and therefore a common pipeline for characterizing prokaryotic genomic materials is needed.

“PEPR”, Pipelines for Evaluating Prokaryotic References, a set of reproducible and transperent bioinformatic pipelines, was developed to characterize genomic materials for use in WGS method validation. Application of the pipeline increases the confidence in method validation through the ability to develop better characterized control materials. The pipeline characterizes prokaryotic genomic material for purity and homogeneity of the genome sequence, as well as presence of genomic material other than the material genus. The general approach to material characterization that guided the development of PEPR is the use of orthogonal sequencing methods along with technical replicates to obtain consensus values for the characterized properties. These consensus values are our best current estimates of the true values. We do not assert probabilistic estimates of confidence or confidence classification values with the sequence data, as we lack good models of biases or systematic errors of current sequencing technologies. Here we will first describe PEPR then demonstrate the application of the pipelines using sequencing data generated for the genomic DNA \emph{Staphloyoccous aureus} NIST candidate reference reference material.

\section{Methods}

%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Here again I feel like the order could be a little improved.  It doesn’t seem to quite flow, and it doesn’t match the results order either.  You could consider putting the S aureus part first and then the pipeline.  (Although I think I understand why you would want to put the pipeline first – because that is the main message from the manuscript)

\label{methods}
\subsection{Pipelines for Evaluating Prokaryotic References: PEPR}
\label{method:1}
PEPR consists of three bioinformatic pipelines written in python (Fig. \ref{fig:workflowFig}).  The three bioinformatic pipelines are genome evaluation, genome characterization, and genomic purity. A YAML file (http://yaml.org) is used to define pipeline inputs. The pipeline coordinates the execution of a number of commandline tools, logging the standard output and standard error for each executed command in time-stamped files for reference and debugging. Pipeline code is available at (https://github.com/usnistgov/pepr). To reduce the barrier for reuse, two Docker (https://www.docker.com/) containers are available with pre-installed pipeline dependencies. Docker is a lightweight virtual environment that facilitates the sharing and distribution of computing environments and can be run on any desktop, cloud, or high performance computing environment, regardless of the operating system. The \texttt{pepr} container (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/natedolson/pepr) includes dependencies for the genome evaluation and characterization pipelines, excluding the Genome Analysis Toolkit (due to licensing restrictions); a Dockerfile for building the container is included in the pepr github repository. The \texttt{docker-pathoscope} container (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/natedolson/docker-pathoscope/) has dependencies for the genomic purity pipeline installed.

%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Fig. 1 needs a caption.  Also, I don’t clearly see these 3 pipelines in the figure.  I see a flow, but not the 3 individual pipelines. 


A software package, \texttt{peprr}, was developed for the statistical computing language R to compile the output from the genome evaluation, characterization, and genomic purity pipelines \cite{R2015}. The compiled data was formated into a series of data tables within a SQLite database to facilitate downstream analysis \cite{wickham2014tidy}.  The package includes functions to generate a number of summary tables and figures, including those in this publication.

\subsection{Genome Evaluation Pipeline}
\label{method:2}
The Genome Evaluation Pipeline, \texttt{evaluation}, is the first step in the PEPR workflow, and is used to reduce errors in the user provided genome assembly prior to characterization. The \texttt{evaluation} pipeline consists of three steps.  Illumina sequencing data are retrieved from the Genbank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using the sratoolkit \texttt{fastq-dump} (http://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/). Next, sequencing reads are mapped to the reference genome using BWA mem algorithm \cite{Li2013c}. Finally, Pilon is used to evaluate and polish the reference assembly \cite{Walker2014}. The corrected reference genome is then used as input for the Genome Characterization Pipeline.

\subsection{Genome Characterization Pipeline}
\label{method:3}
The Genome Characterization Pipeline uses replicate sequence dataset from multiple sequencing platforms to characterize the corrected reference genome produced by the \texttt{evaluation} pipeline at the individual base level. Illumina data are aligned to the reference genome using the same methods as the \texttt{evaluation} pipeline. Additionally, Pacific Biosciences sequencing data is mapped to the reference genome using the BWA mem algorithm \cite{Li2013c} and IonTorrent PGM data using the TMAP algorithm \cite{Homer}. Next the sequence alignment files are processed prior to downstream analysis by marking duplicates with Picard's MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and realigning reads mapping to regions with insertions or deleltion using the GenomeAnalysisToolKit \cite{McKenna2010, DePristo12011}. After refining the alignment files, base level analysis is performed using the short read sequencing data.  For each platform a VCF (variant call format) file with a number of summary statistics is generated using SAMtools mpileup \cite{Li2009}. A base purity metric is calculated from the resulting VCF files. The base purity metric is the number of bases in reads aligned to a genome position that are in agreement with the reference base divided by the total number of reads aligned to the position. Homogeneity analysis, a measure of genomic content similarity between vials of the reference material, is performed by first generating a pileup file for each dataset then performing pairwise tumor-normal variant calling using VarScan \cite{Koboldt2009}. In this work, VarScan looks specifically for differences between vials in the proportion of reads containing variants. A standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to assess the power of the homogeneity analysis (Supplemental Material, https://github.com/DanSBS/NGSPower).  Additionally, a number of summary statistics are calculated for the sequencing datasets using Picard's Collect Multiple Metrics (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).  
%%% What are the summary statistics? from samtools and Picard?

\subsection{Genome Purity Pipeline}
\label{method:4}
The purity of the genomic material, in terms of the presence of DNA from sources other than the expected genus was assessed using the metagenomic taxonomic read classification algorithm PathoScope 2.0 \cite{Hong2014}.  This method uses an expectation maximization algorithm where the sequence data are first mapped to a database comprised of all sequence data in the Genbank nt database. Then, through an iterative process PathoScope re-assigns ambiguously mapped reads to a taxonomic group based on the proportion of reads mapped unambiguously to individual taxonomic groups in the database. Using short read sequencing data as input PathoScope first filters and trims low quality reads (PathoQC), followed by mapping reads to a reference database (PathoMap - a wrapper for bowtie2 \cite{Langmead2012}), then an expectation-maximization classification algorithm (PathoID).  The annotated Genbank nt database provided by the PathoScope developers was used as the reference database (ftp://pathoscope.bumc.bu.edu/data/nt\_ti.fa.gz).

\subsection{Sequencing Data Summary Statistics}
Summary statistics were calculated for the number of reads, mapped read length, insert size for paired-end datasets as well as coverage for \emph{S. aureus} datasets (Table \ref{Table:seqTable}). The MiSeq sequencing run had an average of  \Sexpr{round(mean_miseq_library_read_count/2000000, digits = 1)} million paired-end reads per library with a median read length of  \Sexpr{miseq_med_read_length} bp,  whereas the PGM sequencing run produced \Sexpr{round(mean_pgm_library_read_count/2000000, digits = 1)} million reads per library on average with a median read length of \Sexpr{pgm_med_read_length} bp.  The higher throughput of MiSeq resulted in a higher per-library coverage for MiSeq compared to PGM (\Sexpr{paste0(as.character(mean_miseq_library_coverage),"X")} vs. \Sexpr{ paste0(as.character(mean_pgm_library_coverage),"X")}).  The three PacBio datasets are technical sequencing replicates (SMRT cells) from the same sequencing library, with a median subread length \Sexpr{paste0(as.character(pacbio_med_read_length),"bp")} and \Sexpr{paste0(as.character(pacbio_total_coverage),"X")} total coverage. Between the three platforms a total coverage of \Sexpr{paste0(as.character(total_coverage),"X")} was obtained.

\subsection{Genome Evaluation}
The first step in PEPR is the Genome Evaluation Pipeline.  Short read sequencing data is used to identify and correct errors in the user-provided reference genome, in this case the PacBio HGAP assembly that was initially validated using the optical mapping data. Running Pilon using the MiSeq data did not identify any missassemblies or base call errors.

\subsection{Base Level Purity}

A base purity metric was used to evaluate the degree to which the sequencing data supports the reference base call.  We compared purity metric values between two orthogonal sequencing methods for all positions in the genome (Fig. \ref{fig:purityScatterFig}). Positions with purity metric values greater than 99 \% were categorized as high purity and less than 99 \% low purity. Out of \Sexpr{total_pos} positions in the genome \Sexpr{pos_pur_gt99_both} positions had purity values greater than 99 \% for both short read sequencing platforms (Table \ref{Table:purityTable}).  Further, \Sexpr{pos_pur_gt99_one} and \Sexpr{ pos_pur_gt97_one} positions had purity values greater than 99 \% and 97 \%, respectively, for one of the two platforms.  Only \Sexpr{pos_pur_lt99_both} positions had a purity less than 99 \% for both platforms, and no positions had a purity value less than \Sexpr{min_max_pur_position} \% for both platforms. The positions with low purity for MiSeq were non-uniformly distributed whereas positions with low purity for PGM were uniformly distributed (Fig. \ref{fig:purityPositionFig}).

\subsubsection{Base Level Homogeneity}
%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Relative to last sentence/ table 3 - This was unclear to me, but I haven’t read the supplemental info yet—is that where it is?
The genomic material homogeneity was assessed through pairwise statistical analysis of the replicate MiSeq datasets using the VarScan somatic variant caller \cite{Koboldt2009}.  The pairwise variant analysis failed to identify any statistically significant base level differences among the replicates (Table \ref{Table:homogeneityTable}).

%%% So the output is a single number?  Does it come with an uncertainty? - regarding proportion of DNA

%%% Make sure space between number and %
Short read sequencing data was used to identify the proportion of DNA in the material from an organism other than the material genus, in this case \emph{Staphylococcus}, using PathoScope 2.0 \cite{Hong2014} . Based on analysis of the MiSeq and PGM sequencing data, the reference material has minimal if any genomic contaminants (Fig. \ref{fig:contamCountsFig}), with a maximum of \Sexpr{max_contam} reads in any dataset classified as not belonging to the genus \emph{Staphylococcus}. The most abundant contaminant was \emph{Escherichia coli} (Fig. \ref{fig:contamTaxaFig}).

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{PEPR}
%%% Nancy's comments
%%% You describe what it does.  Would it be helpful to give the advantages for using multiple reps and multiple platforms?  (or is it too obvious?)
%%% You may want to mention that the sequence is used in conjunction with the actual genomic material?
Pipelines for Evaluating Prokaryotic References (PEPR) is designed to use biological and technical replicate sequencing data from orthogonal sequencing platforms to characterize the genome of a microbial material.  The resulting characterized genome is suitable for use in evaluating and benchmarking whole genome sequencing methods. PEPR consists of three pipelines: genome evaluation, genome characterization, and genomic purity assessment.

%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Use of step in place of pipeline in third sentence - Interesting – should they be steps in the overall pipeline rather than pipelines themselves??, Which pipeline – the PEPR or the evaluation pipeline?  Is the accuracy of the pipeline or the ref assembly? Based on the short read data?  Does it just change things if  they don’t agree?
%%% This is done prior to PEPR, right? - regarding comparison of genome assembly and optical mapping data
%%% Some of this sounds like methods again…
The evaluation step in the PEPR pipeline provides an automated method to evaluate and refine a reference genome.The evaluation pipeline takes a reference genome and uses the genome assembly polishing and assessment tool Pilon \cite{Walker2014}.  Pilon was chosen for the genome evaluation step as it not only assesses the accuracy of the pipeline but also correct errors in the assembly.  Other methods are available for evaluating reference genomes, e.g. amosvalidate \cite{Phillippy2008} and ALE \cite{Clark2013}, however these methods only assess assembly accuracy and do not correct missassemblies.  Agreement between the PacBio assembly, Optical Mapping data, and MiSeq Pilon analysis allows for increased confidence in the PacBio reference assembly.  The resulting reference assembly represents a consensus genome for the population of cells used to generate the material being characterized.  The genome evaluation pipeline does not attempt to identify or characterize low frequency structural variants within the material or vial-to-vial variability of the reference genome. 

The reference genome, once validated and if nessessary refined by the Genome Evaluation Pipeline, is then used as input for the Genome Characterization Pipeline that calculates base level statistics using replicate sequencing data from orthogonal measurement methods.  Additionally, the Genome Characterization Pipeline generates summary statistics for the sequencing datasets used in the material characterization.  The results from the Genome Evaluation and Characterization pipeline are loaded into peprDB, an SQLite database, using the \texttt{createPeprDB} function of the \texttt{peprr} package. Loading the data into a SQLite database makes it easier to perform additional analyses of the material characterization and evaluation results.

%% Why six vials?

If another lab wishes to characterize a new reference or quality control material, they could follow this process:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ideally, the user should generate a large batch of material and aliquot it to reduce inhomogeneity.
    \item Identify a high-quality genome assembly. If a good reference assembly does not exist for the sample, then long-read sequencing like PacBio may be required to generate an assembly, and ideally mapping technologies would be used to validate the assembly.
    \item Short-read whole genome sequencing, preferably from two orthogonal sequencing technologies, should be generated from multiple vials of the material, ideally 2 technical replicate libraries from at least six randomly selected vials.
    \item PEPR can then be run to assess base-level purity and homogeneity, genomic contaminants, and mis-assemblies.
The methods presented in this work provide a straightforward pipeline that can be used by any laboratory to characterize new reference materials or in-house quality controls.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{PEPR Application: Characterization of Candidate RM 8376 using PEPR}
\subsubsection{Genome Assembly}
%%% The assembly is pre-PEPR, right?  Do you want to differentiate the eval and char pipelines with headings, as you did the purity?

In this work, the closed candidate reference genome was assembled using PacBio long read data and used as input for PEPR.  To assess accuracy of the reference genome, whole genome mapping data generated with the OpGen optical mapping technology, an orthogonal measurement method, was used to evaluate the genome assembly. Optical mapping results were used to assess the overall structure of the genome. The long DNA fragments (average size \textgreater 200Mb) allow for the evaluation of large misassemblies (\textless 3 kb) that are not easily identified using standard short read sequencing data \cite{Mendelowitz2014}.  Optical mapping technologies and large insert mate-pair library preparation methods, including Illumina's TruSeq Synthetic Long-Reads \cite{McCoy2014}, represent orthogonal methods that can also be used to identify large misassemblies for validating reference assemblies for use in PEPR.  In this work, after using optical mapping to validate that no large misassemblies existed, the reference assembly from PacBio was used as input for the PEPR. 

\subsubsection{Sequencing Dataset Summary}
%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Do you want to mention what it is for the strain you are using?

The PEPR database (peprDB) includes a number of summary statistics for the sequencing datasets processed.  For sequencing datasets used to characterize the NIST candidate reference material RM8376, throughput and read lengths were as expected based on the library prep and sequencing methods used excluding the PGM datasets. For PGM the 400 bp sequencing and library preparation methods yielded median read lengths of \Sexpr{pgm_med_read_length} bp. The shorter read length is potentially due to the low GC content, which is known to challenge current sequencing technologies \cite{Quail2012}.  

\subsubsection{Base Level Purity}
%%% Nancy's comment
%%% This is interesting, because it is stated in a different way from earlier.  Is this just the short read methods? - regarding pooled
%%% Regarding third sentence - Is this from the reference assembly, or the reads?  Or is PacBio only used to create the ref assembly and then for nothing else? Should this be mentioned earlier?

To assess the purity of a genome position or base in the material as a whole, replicate sequencing datasets were pooled by sequencing platform.  SAMtools mpileup was used to calculate the number of base calls that support or disagree with the reference base.  The base call counts are used to calculate the base level purity values.  Through comparison of the base purity for two orthogonal sequencing methods we identified genome positions with low purity values due to platform specific systematic sequencing errors. The reference base is identified using a third orthogonal sequencing method (PacBio RSII), which only chooses the dominant base and does not identify small impurities. Thus, a low purity (below 50\%) for one of the two short read sequencing platforms and a high purity value for the other means that two technologies (one short read and one long read) agree that the dominant base is the reference base. It is also important to acknowledge that even if two platforms agree about an impurity, they are potentially susceptible to the same unknownbias and thus the outlier platform could represent the true value.  The sequencing technologies used to characterize the material are still maturing and an incomplete understanding of platform specific biases limits our ability to provide a confidence value for the base calls.

%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Anything else to mention here?  Is it useful to provide a full list of what the output is?  What you have provided for S aureus seems limited/reduced.

A number of base level metrics, such as strand bias, are calculated as part of the PEPR Genome Characterization Pipeline and are included in the pipeline results database. These metrics can be used to differentiate positions with low purity due to measurement error and those due to biological variability. Use of additional metrics and algorithms developed for the identification of low frequency variants, such as loFreq \cite{Wilm2012}, could help identify positions with low levels of biological variability, but are not currently implemented in PEPR.

%%% Nancy's comment 
%%% Regarding the term homogeneity
%%% Is this in terms of vial to vial?  (which this isn’t supposed to do)  if, not, then homogeneity in terms of what?  Were the technical replicates compared only to themselves and not to the other vials?  Can 2 replicates from a vial really give you homogeneity within that vial?
The PEPR Genome Characterization Pipeline assesses the homogeneity of a material through comparison of purity values between technical replicates.  The homogeneity analysis is performed using the varscan tumor-normal variant caller \cite{Koboldt2009}.  Only MiSeq data was used to assess the homogeneity of the material as the higher coverage increased the statistical power of the test, and the replicate libraries provide information regarding the method error rate.  No statistically significant variants were identified between all pairwise comparisons indicating that the material is homogeneous. If potential inhomogeneities were found, then the PGM sequencing data could be examined to see if it also has evidence for the inhomogeneities.

\subsection{Genomic Purity Pipeline}
%%% Nancy's comment
%%% I think you should comment on limitations of recognizing genus-level contaminants only.
%%% Do you want to say what we can do with the data now?  
The Genomic Purity Pipeline is used to identify DNA within the material that belongs to a genus other than the material genus.  The genus level cutoff was selected based on results from a previous study characterizing the specificity of the PathoScope classification algorithm (Olson et al. \emph{in-prep}). Genomic contaminants can be from the culture itself or reagents and materials used to prepare the material \cite{Shrestha2013, Tang2003, Salter2014}.  Contaminants identified by the \texttt{genomic\_purity} pipeline may not be present in the material. For example reagents used during library preparation may also include contaminants \cite{Tanner1998, Newsome2004, Motley2014, Salter2014}.  Additionally, bioinformatic errors may lead to false positive contaminants, either due to errors in the database, sequence misclassification, or errors in the classification algorithm itself.  Genomic purity analysis of the \emph{S. aureus} material identified a number of candidate contaminants,  the most abundant of which was \emph{E. coli}.  \emph{E. coli} is a well documented contaminant of molecular biology reagents, and not likely a true contaminant \cite{Salter2014}. Lower abundant contaminants maybe bioinformatic errors and not true contaminants. While, contaminants identified by the Genomic Purity Pipeline are most likely from reagents and due to bioinformatic errors, a conservative estimate of the material purity, assuming all contaminants are real, is output from the pipeline.

\section{Conclusions}
%%% Nancy's comment
%%% Again, I feel like it is worth mentioning the outputs of PEPR – a corrected Ref assembly, identification of high (and low) purity positions based on biol and technol variations, % contaminant genus, homogeneity (within vial), and others? But maybe that is just me being new to (or somewhat outside of) the field. 
%%% Regarding "reproducibile and transparent workflow - I was waiting for this—don’t recall seeing it earlier.  This is part of the draw of PEPR, right?  I suggest mentioning in the abstract and intro and discussion too!
%%% End of paragraph - And then what – there is a bigger picture here, right?  now that we (and soon everyone else) have well-characterized materials, just think what we can do!
PEPR provides a framework for characterizing microbial genomic reference materials, for instance using a homogenized batch of DNA from a single prokaryotic strain.  The objective in developing PEPR was to provide a reproducible and transparent workflow for the characterization of prokaryotic genomic materials. The pipeline can be used to characterize reference materials as well as in-house quality control materials for which replicate sequencing datasets from multiple platforms is available.  The resulting characterization values are intentionally conservative and without uncertainty or confidence estimates, as sources of bias and error associated with the measurement process are currently not fully understood. As the scientific community's understanding of the measurement process matures new algorithms can be incorporated into the pipeline to increase the quality of material characterization results.
